    <p>This is my favorite metagame of competetive Pokemon, I find the elements and counterpicks of this metagame to be extremely fun.</p>
    <p>The top threats in this metagame include <ul><li></li><b>Tyranitar</b>, </li><li><b>Zapdos</b>, </li><li><b>Metagross</b>, </li><li><b>Skarmory</b>, </li><li>and <b>Blissey</b>.</li></ul></p>
    <hr>
    <p>Gen 3 OU stands out in particular as a <i>Spikes</i> metagame, in which the Spikes entry hazard is one of the dominant forces upon gameplay. Spikes dissincentivizes switch-stalling and greatly alters the matagame. Additionally as a <em>permanent weather</em> metagame, sandstorm stays up indefinitely, making <b>Tyranitar</b> potentially the most dominant pokemon of this metagame.</p>
    <p>an important part of competetive Pokemon is <em>teambuilding</em>! You can have a team full of good pokemon, and still have a bad team.<br>Likewise, you can have a team with a Pokemon that is otherwise lower-ranked, but performs a certain role very well.</p>
    <p>anyways look at this div <div>whoah</div> and this span <span>wowzers</span>!!</p>
    <nav>You can try out this metagame and teambuilding on <a href="https://pokemonshowdown.com/">here!</a></nav>
    <ol><li>go to the website</li><li>make a team with valid gen 3ou pokemon</li><li>Play the game</li></ol>
